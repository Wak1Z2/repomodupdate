	- In the config you can change the chance that each upgrade level which gets synced for late joining player.

## [2.1.2] - 2025-12-02

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added

- Host-Only Authority: The mod is now fully server-side. Only the host needs to install the mod for upgrades to be shared and synced with all clients (even vanilla clients).

- Smart Upgrade Syncing:

	- Implemented an intelligent system that distinguishes between Vanilla and Modded upgrades automatically.

	- Vanilla upgrades use native game commands (TesterUpgradeCommandRPC) to ensure immediate upgrade syncing and visual feedback.

	- Custom/Modded upgrades use a "Safe Sync" method (UpdateStatRPC) to sync values without crashing clients that do not have the custom mod installed.

- Dynamic Vanilla Discovery: The mod now uses reflection to automatically identify valid vanilla upgrades at runtime. This makes the mod highly compatible with future game updates without needing constant patches.

- Improved Late Join System:

	- Refactored late-join logic to hook into PlayerAvatar.Start, ensuring reliable syncing regardless of when a player joins.

	- Added specific safety checks to prevent sync logic from running in non-game scenes like the Main Menu or Splash Screen.

### Changed

- Rewrote Shared Upgrades Logic: Moved from a hardcoded list of components to a dynamic stat-monitoring system. This allows the mod to support almost any custom upgrade mod out of the box.

- Since the mod has now been completely rewritten from the ground up since the original [fork](https://github.com/W1ll-Gale/better.repo.mods/tree/mods.better-team-upgrades) the mod has now moved to its own standalone [Github repository](https://github.com/W1ll-Gale/BetterTeamUpgrades).
